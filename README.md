At one of my jobs, tracking the exact hours spent on each project was taken very seriously. We had to meticulously log our hours, but the constant switching between projects throughout the day made an Excel spreadsheet an inefficient way to organize so much information. At the end of each day, we still had to manually tally the hours worked on each project and enter them into the company’s management system.

This workflow led me to develop my own time-tracking application in Python. It allows users to create projects, assign all necessary details, and log the hours worked on each one. Thanks to SQLite’s built-in tools, retrieving and analyzing this data later became much more convenient.

To use it, you'll need the Python Tabulate library for structured data display.
